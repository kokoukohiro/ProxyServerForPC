# ProxyServerForPC
A proxy server that can be run on a personal computer.
You can find the original version from [here](http://www.mentalis.org/soft/projects/proxy/).
To implement the proxy function at least two people need to run the program at the same time.
It is used to solve the problem of high online latency, but you need to find someone with low latency to be the server.
